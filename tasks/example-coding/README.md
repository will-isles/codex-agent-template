# Example Coding Task

Goal: Add a simple `doctor` target to verify required tools.

Status: Implemented in the Makefile. Use this task to practice reading the repo and making focused changes.

How to try:
- Open a Codex session: `make run`
- Ask the agent to enhance the `doctor` checks (e.g., verify prompt files), keeping changes minimal.
